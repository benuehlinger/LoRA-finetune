# LoRA-finetune
This repository holds my code used to aid research in comparing LoRA and full finetuning.

1. distilbert_full_finetune.ipynb: This code performs full finetuning on the distilbert model and commit to huggingface
2. lora_finetune_eval.ipynb: This code performs LoRA finetuning on the distilbert model, loads in the full fine model and evaluates them on new sentences. 

For more information, please see my medium article [here]
